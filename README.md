# Google Photos Downloader

### Motivation
The main reason why I started this project was to solve my problem of having to seek my favorite photos inside each album in Google Photos, downloading them and then processing each one (reducing size to Instagram's max resolution with minimum detail loss and adding a white border around it).


### Main Goal
The main goal of this project is to make an application capable of easily downloading all favorite photos from a Google Photos Library or an album and processing them.

### To-do (maybe?)

Make a GUI for the script, making it easier and more user-friendly for the Photography Community.

Add a subtitle generator and the possibility to post the photos to Instagram

### Finished
Right now, the script can list all the albums, list the photos inside a chosen album and download all favorite photos or an albums
The function for processing the images is done and with a few tests, INTER_AREA was found to be the best method for rescaling the image.
